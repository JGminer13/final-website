		<nav id="navbar"><h2 style="color:white;">Thumbnails. You might be saying “WHAT DO MY NAILS HAVE TO DO WITH YOUTUBE DUMBASS”. And your answer is nothing. Thumbnails are the pictures you see when you click on a video. Usually photoshopped, they are the utmost importance when uploading video. Now you can use one of the 3 pictures it selects from your video but they’re trash. I recommend using photoshop or pixlr.com to make your own thumbnails. And remember PEOPLE HATE CLICKBAIT, DON'T USE IT. Now if you're dumb and want to use clickbait. Read the box and the right for more information on the horrible thing.
So you're reading this box, so it means you're dumb enough to use it. Now i’m not saying don’t use it because it gets you views. It also gets you hate. People HATE clickbait. Basicly clickbait is a thumbnail or title with misleading information so you can get views and in some cases subscribers. Now like i said it’s not bad and honestly not a bad idea. I personally don’t use it but if you want to use clickbait go right ahead.</h2></nav>
